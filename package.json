  "description": "​ You will be implementing a Pokemon battle game using the Object Oriented Programming skills you've learned this week! ​ For those of you unfamiliar with Pokemon, you can think about it as people (trainers) who have pets (pokemon), that live inside tiny houses (pokeballs). Trainers can only hold a maximum 6 pokeballs. ​ These people are also a bit strange, and they get their pets into fights with other people's pets in the park for no reason at all... ​",
